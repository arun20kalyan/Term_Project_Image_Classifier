# Term_Project_Image_Classifier

About the project: In this project, we have a data set taken from Kaggle (Mango🥭 Leaf🍃🍂 Disease Dataset), which has 8 classes. On which we try to apply the CNN and decision tree to classify the images and compare their accuracies.

Pre-requisites: This does not require any installations as the project is built on jupyter notebook.

How to run the project:

Open Jupyter notebook. Pull the code. Download the dataset from '(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryashah2k/mango-leaf-disease-dataset)' and upload it to jupyter.
